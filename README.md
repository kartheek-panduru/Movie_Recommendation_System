# Movie_Recommendation_System

**About the project**\
In this project I've created a model where a user can give the name of their favourite movie and this model helps to recommend movies which are alike.

**Why Do We Need Recommender Systems?**\
For any given product, there are sometimes thousands of options to choose from. Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like. From a business standpoint, the more relevant products a user finds on the platform, the higher their engagement. This often results in increased revenue for the platform itself. Various sources say that as much as 35–40% of tech giants’ revenue comes from recommendations alone.

**Workflow**
1. Data Collection 
2. Data pre-processing
3. Feature extraction - We convert the text format data into numerical values in order to find the similarity score between them.
4. User input - getting the name of the user's favourite movie
5. Cosine Similarity - Used in order to find the similarity between the featured vectors
6. Recommending a list of movies
